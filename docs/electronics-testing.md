# Word Clock (Feather) Electronics Testing

This document contains the complete instructions for testing the electronics components for the project. For instructions on how to assemble the electronics, refer to [Electronics Assembly](electronics-assembly.md).

I added this document because I figured you'd want to test the hardware configuration before completing the enclosure assembly. To help you, I wrote a simple [test sketch](https://github.com/johnwargo/world-clock-neomatrix-8x8-wifi/tree/main/assembly-test) and included it with the project.

> **Note:** You may have to tweak the configuration of the test sketch if you changed any of the hardware for the project or connected the NeoPixel Matrix to a different output port on the Feather device.
