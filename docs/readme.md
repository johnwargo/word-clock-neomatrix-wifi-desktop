# Word Clock (Feather) Documentation

To keep this readme as simple as possible, I moved the assembly and software configuration instructions into separate files:

* [Electronics Assembly & testing](electronics-assembly.md)
* [Enclosure Assembly](enclosure-assembly.md)
* [Software Configuration & Deployment](software.md)
