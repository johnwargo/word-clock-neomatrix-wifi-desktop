# Word Clock (Feather) Documentation

To keep this readme as simple as possible, I moved the assembly and software configuration instructions into separate files:

1. [Electronics Assembly](electronics-assembly.md)
2. [Electronics Testing](electronics-testing.md)

3. [Enclosure Assembly](enclosure-assembly.md)

4. [Software Configuration & Deployment](software.md)
