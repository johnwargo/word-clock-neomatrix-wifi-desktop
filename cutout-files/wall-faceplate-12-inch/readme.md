# World Clock 12-Inch Faceplate

I wanted to make a 12 inch version of the World Clock and I wanted a little extra border around the faceplate so I could easily build a wooden frame around the clock face. The folks at [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/) were kind enough to manipulate the file for me and, of course, LASER cut a couple for me. 

I also wanted a frosted piece to mount behind the faceplate so I threw together a quick little drawing I could upload to Ponoko to cut that for me as well. I'm not a graphics person, so I simply drew the piece I needed in Visio, then saved it as a `.svg` file.

Files in this folder:

* `word-clock-faceplate-12-inch-ponoko.eps` - The World Clock faceplate at 12.5" x 12.5"; I Added 0.25" border to each side so I could fit the faceplace inside of a 0.25" groove in the wooden enclosure I'm building for this.
* `world-clock-blank-12-inch.svg` - A simple 12.5" x 12.5" solid piece I could have LASER cut and use as a difuser behind the faceplate.
