* Desktop Enclosure Trinket - this folder contains the original enclosure cutout files for the original project's Adafruit Trinket microcontroller.
* Wall Faceplate 12 Inch - Contains the cutout files for a 12 inch (12.5 x 12.5 with border) faceplate for a wall mounted clock. This is just the faceplate, you'll need to build your own enclosure around it.
