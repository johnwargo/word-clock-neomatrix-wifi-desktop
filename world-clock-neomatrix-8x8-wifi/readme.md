# World Clock NeoMatrix 8x8 Wi-Fi

This folder contains the Arduino source code for the project. 



Before you try to compile and deploy this code, you must first rename the `config.copyme` file to `config.h`

To do this on Microsoft Windows, you can open Windows Explorer (the file system browser app) and rename it there.  If you're comfortable with the command line, you can open a Command Prompt, navigate to the project folder, and execute the following command:

```shell
rename config.copyme config.h
```

On Linux and macOS, open a terminal window, navigate to the project folder, and execute the following command:

```shell
mv config.copyme config.h
```
