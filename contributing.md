# Contributing to this Project

I use the traditional GitHub workflow to manage this project. To make a contribution, or participate in this project, please use the information in this document to guide your efforts.

## Questions or Comments

If you have a question or comment about the code or documentation, use the [Issues](https://github.com/johnwargo/world-clock-neomatrix-8x8-wifi/issues) section of the repository to post it. When you submit something there, GitHub will send me an email notifying me and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I don't check personal email much during the business day, so I usually work through my inbox at night. 

Here's some guidelines to follow:

* Be nice. Ooh, and patient too.
* Be helpful; and that means providing as much detailed information as possible to help me understand your issue/problem.
* Be respectful.
* If you need help troubleshooting a problem with the code or software configuration, I'll try, but this isn't my day job. I will not hold your hand as you work through whatever issue(s) you have.

## Contributions

If you find a typo, simple error, or something missing from the docs, then go ahead and submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/johnwargo/world-clock-neomatrix-8x8-wifi/pulls), and I'll give it a look as soon as I can.

If you see something that needs to be fixed in the code, or have some enhancement that you think may improve the project, then I'm interested in hearing about it. But, before you write a bunch of code and associated documentation, talk with me about it first. There may be a reason the feature isn't already in the code. I don't want to waste your time on something I may not accept. Start by creating an [Issue](https://github.com/johnwargo/world-clock-neomatrix-8x8-wifi/issues) describing the problem/need and your proposed solution. We'll have a discussion about it here, and decide together what to do with the idea before you go galloping off to write code.
